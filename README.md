# Project description
The objective of this assignment involved using Object Oriented Design and Programming in **Java** to create the simulation of an airplane's booking system.

# Revival Period

 I have proposed the reimplementation of the project using updated skills in OOD, OOP, and unit testing. It is my hope that the project can further showcase skills in these areas. 
 
 
 Stay tuned.
